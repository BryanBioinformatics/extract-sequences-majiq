# Junction Annotation and Sequence Extraction Pipeline

A fast, reliable, and memory-efficient pipeline for adding strand information and extracting junction sequences using gene symbols from LSV IDs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/junction-annotation-pipeline.git
cd junction-annotation-pipeline

# Install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate junction-annotation

# Run the pipeline
./run_junction_pipeline.sh
```

## 📋 Overview

This pipeline takes a CSV file with junction information and:
1. **Extracts gene symbols** from LSV IDs (e.g., `TSPAN6:s:chrX:100632485-100632568:chrX:100629986-100632485`)
2. **Looks up strand information** from a GTF file
3. **Extracts 1002bp sequences** around junctions with proper strand orientation

## 🎯 Key Features

- **⚡ Fast**: Completes in minutes (vs. hours for complex annotation)
- **📊 Reliable**: 98.6% success rate for strand assignment
- **💾 Memory efficient**: No large GRanges objects
- **🔧 Simple**: Direct gene symbol lookup approach
- **🧬 Biologically accurate**: Proper strand orientation for sequences

## 📊 Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Success rate** | 98.6% |
| **Processing time** | ~5 minutes |
| **Memory usage** | <2GB |
| **Output size** | 492MB (427,937 junctions) |

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Conda or Miniconda

### Setup
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate junction-annotation
```

## 📖 Usage

### Input Format

Your CSV should have LSV IDs in the first column with format:
```
GENE:s:coordinates:coordinates
```

Example:
```
TSPAN6:s:chrX:100632485-100632568:chrX:100629986-100632485
FIRRM:s:chr1:169795040-169795213:chr1:169795100-169795829
```

### Required Files

1. **Input CSV**: `17samples_imputed_min10coverage.csv`
2. **GTF file**: `references/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.113.gtf`
3. **Reference genome**: `references/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa`

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Single command to run everything
./run_junction_pipeline.sh
```

### Output

The pipeline produces:
- `17samples_imputed_min10coverage_with_strand.csv` (intermediate)
- `17samples_imputed_min10coverage_with_sequences.csv` (final)

Final output contains:
- All original columns
- `strand` - Strand information (+ or -) as 3rd column
- `sequence` - 1002bp sequence with proper strand orientation as 4th column

## 🧬 Strand Orientation

Sequences are extracted with consistent biological orientation for model training:

- **Positive strand (+):** `donor_sequence + acceptor_sequence`
- **Negative strand (-):** `reverse_complement(donor_sequence) + reverse_complement(acceptor_sequence)`

**Key Biological Logic:**
- **Always donor → acceptor order** (5' → 3' transcript orientation)
- **Reverse complement for negative strand** (to get transcript sequence)
- **Consistent pattern** for the model: `[donor_context][acceptor_context]`

This ensures the model learns the same splicing pattern regardless of gene strand.

## 🔍 Validation

The pipeline includes comprehensive validation:
- ✅ Sequence accuracy verified against reference genome
- ✅ Strand information validated against GTF file
- ✅ Gene boundaries checked
- ✅ Biological orientation confirmed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Missing strand information
Some junctions may not get strand information if:
- Gene symbol doesn't match GTF file exactly
- Gene is missing from GTF file
- LSV ID format is different than expected

### Memory issues
The pipeline is designed to be memory-efficient. If you encounter issues:
- Ensure you have at least 2GB free memory
- Check that reference files are accessible

### File not found errors
Make sure all required files are in the correct locations:
- Input CSV in the current directory
- GTF and FASTA files in `references/` directory
